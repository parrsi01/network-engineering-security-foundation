## CV Bullet Snippets

- Junior Network Engineer: Built and validated Linux networking labs covering IP addressing, routing, DNS, NAT, firewalling, and packet capture with documented recovery paths.
- Infrastructure Operations Analyst: Practiced evidence-first troubleshooting using `ip`, `ss`, `ping`, `traceroute`, and `tcpdump` to isolate failures by network layer.
- Network Security Analyst: Validated firewall and segmentation behavior against observed packet flow and service exposure, not just intended rule definitions.
- SOC / Detection Analyst: Used network monitoring labs and triage drills to improve log-based alert triage and packet-level investigation workflows.
- Platform / Operations Trainee: Applied change-control habits including rollback planning, validation scripts, and post-fix verification evidence in a version-controlled training repo.
- Technical Documentation: Produced mobile-friendly operational notes, troubleshooting trees, and repeatable runbooks aligned to production support workflows.
