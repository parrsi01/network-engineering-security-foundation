# Run First On Phone

## Mobile-First Start Path

1. Open `01_START_HERE.md` at the repo root
2. Open `environment/01_START_HERE.md` and complete VM setup
3. Open `labs/01_START_HERE.md`
4. Start with `labs/lab_01_linux_network_basics/01_START_HERE.md`
5. In each lab folder, follow the fixed order:
6. `lab_objective.md`
7. `step_by_step_guide.md`
8. `full_solution.md`
9. `common_errors.md`
10. `troubleshooting_tree.md`
11. `validation_script.sh`

## Why This Exists

The mandatory lab filenames are fixed by the repo standard, so this file and the per-folder
`01_START_HERE.md` indexes provide a clear numbered order without renaming required files.
