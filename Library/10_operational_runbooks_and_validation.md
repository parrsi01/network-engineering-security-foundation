# 10 - Operational Runbooks and Validation

## Why Validation Scripts Matter

Lab validation scripts provide repeatable PASS/FAIL checks that reduce ambiguity and force explicit end-state verification.

## Runbook Pattern Used in This Repo

- Objective and operational relevance
- Exact commands and expected outputs
- Misconfiguration simulation
- Debugging walkthrough
- Full solution and validation checklist
- Troubleshooting tree

## Documentation Hygiene Rules

- Real commands only (no pseudocode)
- Ubuntu LTS compatibility
- Permission notes included
- Expected outputs included
- No unresolved task markers or template stubs
